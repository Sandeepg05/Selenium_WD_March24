------------
}
here
 public --> Access modifiers
class ---> keyword
FirstProgram -- ClassName

How to Create a new Maven Project:

         click force updates of snapshot checkbox
          then finally click on ok 



src/main/java   --dev team


src/test/java    --tester

Other than .jave files , .properties, config.properties,xlx,xlsx

src/main/resource
src/test/resource


How to create a new package:
right click on src/main/java
    just hover on new options 
      click package 
              here enter your package name, but all the character should be lower case

How to create a new Class:
   Right click on your package name
           hove on new options
               Click on class
                      enter your class name, but you should follow the naming conmvention 
               click on finish 


What are the naming convention while to followed creating a new classes:
ClassName: --> Pascal Notaions
Start with capital, When we have multiple words the second word onwards init should be capital
  e.g
  Palindrome,FirstProgram,Browser,ChromeBrowser


methodName,objectName,variableName---> camelcase
Start with lowercase, When we have multiple words the second word onwards init should be capital
  e.g
 addTwoNumbers,makeCall,text,




Create a new class names as browser
 inside a class create a main method 
  the syso --> My program execute successfully


Explain main:
public static void main(String[] args){
----
}

public---> It a access modifiers we able to access any where from this project
static  --> static is a keyword, it is also non-access modifiers , we can excute with out instance of a class
void ---> void is a return type, here we can not return anything
main  --> name of the method name, jvm will look into main method and execute this program
String[] args --> comman line aruguments
